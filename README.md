This is a website for FRAM, a webshop for food service. I made this project and aim to create a responsive website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Overview: 

- Visualises a landing page that shows the logo, information on how it works and images of some products. 
- Shows a clean layout that applies to big and smaller screens. 
- Buttons are interactive. 
- Fonts as follows are Arimo and Frank Ruhl and used accordingly. 


Challenges: 

- Keeping the logo centered and icons at the right places 
- Making it look visually appealing on both big and small screens. 


Fixes:

- Used flexbox to align things better
- Added media queries to stack things properly on smaller screens.
